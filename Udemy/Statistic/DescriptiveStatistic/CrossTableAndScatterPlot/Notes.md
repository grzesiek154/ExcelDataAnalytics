# **SCATER PLOT**

When we want to represent two numerical variables on the same graph, we usually use
a scatter plot.

 Scatter plots are useful especially later on, when we talk about regression
analysis, as they help us detect patterns (linearity, homoscedasticity).

Scatter plots usually represent lots and lots of data. Typically, we are not interested in
single observations, but rather in the structure of the dataset
