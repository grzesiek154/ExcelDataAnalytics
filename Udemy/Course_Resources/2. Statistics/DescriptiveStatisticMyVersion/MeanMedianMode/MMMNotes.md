# MEDIAN

 Mediana - to wartość środkowa. 

 Jeżeli mamy wyznaczyć medianę jakiegoś zbioru liczb, to musimy najpierw wypisać te liczby w kolejności niemalejącej, a następnie wybrać liczbę  środkową (w przypadku gdy mamy nieparzystą liczbę liczb w zbiorze).  Jeżeli mamy parzystą liczbę liczb w zbiorze, to mediana jest równa  średniej arytmetycznej dwóch środkowych liczb. 

If the mean becomes misleading because of skewed data and outliers,
then we need some other way of saying what a typical value is. We can
do this by, quite literally, taking the middle value. This is a different
sort of average, and it’s called the median.

How to find the median in three steps:

1. Line your numbers up in order, from smallest to largest.

2. If you have an odd number of values, the median is the one
   in the middle. If you have n numbers, the middle number is
   at position (n + 1) / 2.

3. If you have an even number of values, get the median by
   adding the two middle ones together and dividing by 2.
   You can find the midpoint by calculating (n + 1) / 2. The
   two middle numbers are on either side of this point  



# MODE



In addition to the mean and median, there’s a third type of
average called the mode. The mode of a set of data is the most
popular value, the value with the highest frequency. Unlike the
mean and median, the mode absolutely has to be a value in the
data set, and it’s the most frequent value.
Sometimes data can have more than one mode. If there is
more than one value with the highest frequency, then each
one of these values is a mode. If the data looks as though it’s
representing more than one trend or set of data, then we can
give a mode for each set. If a set of data has two modes, then we
call the data bimodal.
This is exactly the situation we have with the Little Ducklings
class. There are really two sets of ages we’re looking at, one for
parents and one for children, so there isn’t a single age that’s
totally representative of the entire class. Instead, we can say
what the mode is for each set of ages. In the Little Ducklings
class, ages 2 and 32 have the highest frequency, so these ages are
both modes. On a chart, the modes are the ones with the highest
frequencies.

| Age       | 1    | 2    | 3    | 31   | 32   | 33   |
| --------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Frequency | 3    | 4    | 2    | 2    | 4    | 3    |

These two values are the most
popular, so they are both modes.
Here are the modes; they
have the highest frequencies.
It even works with categorical data
The mode doesn’t just work with numeric data; it works
with categorical data, too. In fact, it’s the only sort of average
that works with categorical data. When you’re dealing with
categorical data, the mode is the most frequently occurring
category.
You can also use it to specify the highest frequency group of
values. The category or group with the highest frequency is
called the modal class.
