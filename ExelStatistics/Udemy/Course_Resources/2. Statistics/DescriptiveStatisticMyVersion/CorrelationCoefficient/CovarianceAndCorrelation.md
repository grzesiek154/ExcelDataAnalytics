“Covariance” indicates the direction of the linear relationship between variables. 

“Correlation” on the other hand measures both the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables.

Correlation is a function of the covariance. **What sets them apart is the fact that correlation values are standardized whereas, covariance values are not.** You can obtain the correlation coefficient of two variables by dividing the covariance of these variables by the product of the standard deviations of the same values. If we revisit the definition of Standard Deviation, it essentially measures the absolute variability of a datasets’ distribution. When you divide the covariance values by the standard deviation, it essentially scales the value down to a limited range of **-1 to +1**. This is precisely the range of the correlation values.

Correlation matrix or the covariance matrix? In simple words, you are advised to **use the covariance matrix when the variable are on similar scales and the correlation matrix when the scales of the variables differ.**
