# **BINS**

In statistics, data is usually sorted in one way or another. You might sort the data into classes, categories, by [range ](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/statistics-definitions/range-statistics/)or placement on the number line. 

A **bin**—sometimes called a class interval—is a way of sorting data in a [histogram](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/descriptive-statistics/histogram-make-chart/). It’s very similar to the idea of putting data into categories.

## What is a bin in statistics: Choosing bins

**Choosing bins** can be done by hand for simple  histograms in most cases. For example, if you are making a histogram for exam scores, choosing bins that matches grades (70-79, 80-89, 90-100)  is a fairly obvious choice. You have two numbers associated with each  bin: 

- The low value (sometimes called *bin low*), which in this example would be 70, 80, 90,
- The high value (sometimes called *bin high*) which for this example is 79 89 100.

In most cases though, choosing bins isn’t going to be that simple  especially for large data sets. When dealing with large sets of numbers, you’re usually better off using technology like [Microsoft Excel](https://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel/) to create a histogram ([how to create a histogram in Excel](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/excel-statistics/histogram-in-excel/)), because if your bin choice doesn’t make for a nice-looking diagram you  can dynamically change the bin values without having to draw a graph.
