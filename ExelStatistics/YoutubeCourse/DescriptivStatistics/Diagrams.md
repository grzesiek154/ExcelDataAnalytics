#  Scatter plot

Visualizing bivariate data

Just as with univariate data, you can draw charts for bivariate data tohelp you see patterns. Instead of plotting a value against its frequency orprobability, you plot one variable on the x-axis and the other variable againstit on the y-axis. This helps you to visualize the connection between the twovariables.This sort of chart is called a scatter diagram or scatter plot, anddrawing one of these is a lot like drawing any other sort of chart.Start off by drawing two axes, one vertical and one horizontal. Use thex-axis for one variable and the y-axis for the other. The independent variablenormally goes along the x-axis, leaving the dependent variable to go onthe y-axis. Once you’ve drawn your axes, you then take the values for eachobservation and plot them on the scatter plot.Here’s a scatter plot showing the number of hours of sunshine and concertattendance figures for particular events or observations. As the predictednumber of hours sunshine is the independent variable, we’ve plotted it onthe x-axis. The concert attendance is the dependent variable, so that’s on they-axis.

# Histogram

Histograms are the one of the most common ways to represent
numerical data. Each bar has width equal to the width of the interval.
The bars are touching as there is continuation between intervals: where
one ends -> the other begins.
