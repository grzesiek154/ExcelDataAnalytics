# Descriptive Statistics Tabular, Graphical and Numerical summaries of data.

## Tabular and Graphical Displays For Categorical Variables Single Variable:

### Frequency Distribution:

Is a tabular summary which:

- Lists all the unique values or ranges of values in a set of data, called categories or classes
- Categories must be Collectively Exhaustive Categories (enough categories so nothing is left out) and Mutually Exclusive Categories (no item can fit into more than one category)
- Shows the number of observations (count or frequency) in each of the categories or classes
-  Goal is to is to provide information about frequencies (count)

### Relative Frequency Distribution:

- Shows decimal value that represents "parts compared to the whole" (used in chapter 4 for assigning probabilities)

### Column/Bar/Pie charts:

- Used to show Frequency Distribution or Relative/Percent Frequency Distribution for Categorical Data
- Counts across categories. Height of columns convey(oddawać, wyrażać, przekazywać) count. Order of categories conveys no info
- There are "gaps" between columns to indicate that the data is categorical or a discrete quantitative variable (not a continuous quantitative variable). Columns do not touch

### Pie Chart:

- Used to show Percent Frequency Distribution
- Research shows that Column or Bar Charts may be more effective than Pie Charts

### Pareto Chart:

- Column Chart that is sorted Biggest to Smallest
- Quality Control Pareto Chart (Column Chart Sorted Descending Left To Right) and then add a Cumulative Percentage Line data series to chart







## Tabular and Graphical Displays For Quantitative Variables Single Variable:

### Frequency Distribution:

- Lists all the unique values or ranges of values in a set of data, called categories or classes
- Categories must be Collectively Exhaustive Categories (enough categories so nothing is left out) and Mutually Exclusive Categories (no one item can fit into 2 or more categories)

- Shows the number of observations (count or frequency) in each of the categories or classes
-  Goal is to is to provide information about frequencies (count)

### Creating Classes for Quantitative Variables:

- The goal is to reveal the natural distribution or shape or variation of the data. This is the "art side of statistics". It takes practice to get the hang of it
- Determine the number of nonoverlapping classes. Goal is to have enough to show natural shape of data. One general guideline is: 2^k > n, where n = count and k = number of classes
- Determine the width of each class with something like: approx. width = (Max-Min)/(Number of classes). Trial and error is usually required
- Determine the class limits: the key is to not create classes where you can would double count. Trial and error is usually required
- If you have a discrete variable (or a continuous variable that is shown as a whole number) it is just a matter of getting the lower and upper limit, like: 0-9, 10-19...
- If you have a continuous Variable and you choose to use the upper limit from the previous class as the lower limit for the current class, be sure to include the equal sign on either the lower or upper, but not both. Create classes like: 0 <= Sales < 20, 20 <= Sales <40... or 0 up to 20, 20 up to 40...
- When we create a set of classes, we are creating a type of category for our continuous quantitative variable
- Making the classes all the same width helps to create tables and charts that are more easily interpreted
- Sometimes if there are a few large values or small values, it may be efficient to create an open ended class
- Class midpoint is calculated as the halfway mark between the lower and upper limit
