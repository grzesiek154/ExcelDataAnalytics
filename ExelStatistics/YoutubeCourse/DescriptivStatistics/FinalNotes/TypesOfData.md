# What is statistics?

Statistics is the art and science of collecting, analyzing, presenting and interpreting data to help make informed decisions.

# Descriptive Statistics:

## Raw Data that is summarized and presented:

- Tabular: Table of information
- Graphical: Charts and Graphs
- Numerical: Like an average (mean) or proportion

## Define Terms

### Population: The set of all elements of interest in a particular study

(In many situations it is too costly to get data from all the elements in the population)

### Sample: A subset of the population

Example ==>> Sample survey: Collecting data for a sample



# Raw Data:

Data stored in its smallest size in a Field (Variable):
Store “1234 San Pablo Ave., Oakland, CA 94688” in its smallest bits:
Address = 1234 San Pablo Ave.
City = Oakland
State = CA
Zip = 94688
Raw Data = The characteristics or attributes of the Elements

## Define Terms:

### Element: entities on which data are collected. 

### Field Names (Variables): characteristics or attributes of interest for the elements.

### Records (Observations): The set of measurements collected for a particular element.





# Scales of Measurement for Raw Data

Scales of Measurement = the amount of information that is contained in the data and what sort of summarization, math and statistical techniques we can use.

## Nominal

- Names or labels or categories without rank
- Nothing intrinsic(rzeczywisty) in category except a name

### Examples:

 Eye Color, County Name, Phone Type, Cola Name, Car Brand, or Car Brand where Toyota = 1, Honda = 2, etc.

Using numbers is only for convenience of data storage, like in a database.

Information contained in data = Name

- No math operation on Nominal data
- Count only. Once we count we can calculate the proportion that each got as compared to the total count.
- Can't use Bell Curve

## Ordinal

- Names or labels or categories with an order (ordinal) or rank
- Categories are ranked and have an order, but you do not know the distance between each ranking or ordered item.

### Examples:

Below Par, Par, Above Par
Rating of 1, 2, 3, 4
Rating of: *, **, ***, ****
Rank in a class, a race or in voting: 1, 2, 3, 4
In a race with rankings: You can say who got 1st, 2nd, 3rd, but you don't know by how much
Jan, Feb, Mar…
Information contained in data = Name and Rank, but not distance between each rank
Usually you are counting
Occasionally if the category is a number other calculations like average are okay
Like for an average of rating your professor: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Can't use Bell Curve

## Interval

- Data is numeric
- Data are ranked and the distance between each rank is fixed.

- Usually a scale like temperature or IQ or timed racing results.
- If zero exists, it is just a point on the scale.
- Zero does not mean that nothing exists.

### Examples:

Fahrenheit and Celsius temperature scales
Zero is just a point on the scale, not the absence of molecular kinetic energy
0 just a point, 80 degree not twice as big as 40 degree.
IQ Test or SAT score
0 does not mean total absences of smartness
Information contained in data = Name and Rank, Distance between rankings
Arithmetic like adding, subtraction, averages okay, but ratio is meaningless
Subtracting two temperatures like 80-40 = 40 is okay
80/40 to say that 80 is twice as big as 40 is not okay
You can use the Bell Curve.



## Ratio

- Ranked
- The distance between each rank is fixed
- Zero means that nothing exist
- You can divided two numbers
- Ratio means you can divided.

### Examples:

Test in Stats Class 0 - 100 (0 means you got none correct)
Kelvin temperature (0 means the absence of molecular movement and thus the absence of mass E = mc2)
Total Score In Class, 642, 598, 437
Voting Totals: 10786, 8801, 2022
Dollars (Money), Weight, Height, Length
Information contained in data: Name and Rank, Distance, and more (like % change) 
You can count and use any math operations and use the Bell Curve.
You can divide two numbers and say something like one is double the other (because zero means nothing exists).



# Broad classifications for Types of Data:

## Categorical Variables

Data that is grouped by Categories

Categories, labels or names are used to identify an attribute or characteristics of an element.

- Synonym for Categorical is Qualitative.
- Categorical Variables can be Nominal or Ordinal.
- Can be Non-numeric or numeric.
- Most of the time you are limited to counting.



## Quantitative Variables

- Numbers / Numeric
- A number that tells us how much or how many
- Quantitative Variables can be Interval or Ratio

### Discrete

- Answers the question How Many? (dane policzalne)
- Involves Counting
- There are gaps between numbers, like: 1, 2, 3 or 1.2, 1.3, 1.4

### Continuous:

- Answers the question How Much? (dane nie policzalne)
- Involves Measuring
- The measurement depends on the measurement instrument
- There are no gaps between numbers
- Note: Money is continuous (stocks, bonds, interest are often tracked with partial pennies).

# Cross-Sectional and Time Series Data:

## Cross-Sectional

Data collected at the same or nearly the same point in time.

## Time Series Data

Data collected over time
Useful for seeing trends in the past that may help us to estimate what trends there may be in the near future
